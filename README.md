# Pterodactyl SFTP Server
This package serves as a SFTP server to run alongside the [Pterodactyl Daemon](https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings).
Previous versions of this software included a standalone mode, however this repository now
serves to provide API level access to the Wings Daemon for SFTP access.
